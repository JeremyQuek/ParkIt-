You've asked several excellent questions about SQL, databases, and data storage. Let's break this down step by step:

SQLite:
SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, self-contained relational database engine. It's different from other SQL databases because it doesn't require a separate server process and reads/writes directly to ordinary disk files.
Table storage in SQL:
When you create a table using SQL, where it's stored depends on the database management system (DBMS) you're using:

For traditional DBMS like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server, tables are stored in files on the server where the DBMS is installed.
For SQLite, the entire database (including all tables) is stored in a single file on your local disk.


MongoDB and SQL:
MongoDB is a NoSQL database and doesn't use SQL. Instead, it uses its own query language. You wouldn't use SQL to interact with MongoDB directly. For MongoDB, you'd typically use a MongoDB driver in your programming language of choice.
Purpose of SQL:
SQL is used for managing and querying relational databases. Its main purposes include:

Defining data structures
Storing and retrieving data
Managing data access and modifications
Ensuring data integrity


SQL vs. Python dictionaries or classes:
While both can store data, they serve different purposes:

SQL is for persistent storage and efficient querying of large amounts of structured data.
Python dictionaries or classes are for in-memory data storage during program execution.



Key differences:

Persistence: SQL databases store data permanently, while Python objects exist only while the program runs.
Scale: SQL databases can handle much larger amounts of data efficiently.
Querying: SQL provides powerful ways to search and combine data from multiple tables.
Concurrent access: SQL databases allow multiple users or programs to access data simultaneously.
Data integrity: SQL databases enforce data types, relationships, and constraints.

To illustrate these differences, let's create a simple example using both SQL and Python:

What is a DBMS?
A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that manages databases.
 It provides an interface for users and applications to store, retrieve, update, and manage data. MySQL, PostgreSQL, 
 and SQL Server are all examples of relational DBMS, which use SQL for querying and managing data.
Now, let's look at how to install and access these systems:

MySQL

Installation:

On Ubuntu/Debian:
Copysudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server

On macOS (using Homebrew):
Copybrew install mysql

On Windows:
Download the MySQL Installer from the official MySQL website and follow the installation wizard.

Accessing:

Command line: mysql -u root -p
GUI tools: MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin
Programming languages: Use MySQL connectors (e.g., mysql-connector-python for Python)


PostgreSQL

Installation:

On Ubuntu/Debian:
Copysudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib

On macOS (using Homebrew):
Copybrew install postgresql

On Windows:
Download the installer from the official PostgreSQL website and follow the installation wizard.
